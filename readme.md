php files are all in front end folder.
but to start with the project
run these files in order in backend
    1.createDB.php
    2.createTables.php
    3.addDummydata.php
    4. and then go for front end
        index.php


In the project
we added some dummy data including paths timings to demonstrate
and also added few user and admin members
cardno - 120001     password - 120001       this is for user
cardno - 130001     password - 130001       this is for admin

Ofcourse new ones can be created.
